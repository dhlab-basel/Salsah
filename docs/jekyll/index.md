Salsah is the generic user interface for [Knora](https://knora.org) &mdash; a virtual research environment for the humanities. Knora itself has a restFul API and the following features:

* Stores humanities data as industry-standard RDF graphs, plus files for binary data such as digitized primary sources.
* Based on OWL ontologies that express abstract, cross-disciplinary commonalities in the structure and semantics of research data.
* Offers a generic HTTP-based API, implemented in Scala, for querying, annotating, and linking together heterogeneous data in a unified way.
* Handles authentication and authorization.
* Provides automatic versioning of data.
* Includes [Sipi](http://www.sipi.io), a high-performance media server implemented in C++.

All the tools (Salsah, Knora and Sipi) are developed by the [Digital humanities Lab](https://dhlab.unibas.ch) at the [University of Basel](https://unibas.ch) and supported by the [Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences](httsp://www.sagw.ch).

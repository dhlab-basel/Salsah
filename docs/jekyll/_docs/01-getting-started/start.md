### Install the app dependencies
After cloning the Salsah code, install the needed node packages from the Salsah root directory:

```
$ cd /path/to/your/salsah/installation

$ yarn install --production=false
```


### Start the Salsah app
Now you can start the app with

`$ ng serve`

which will start a server with the app in a developer mode on [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). 

By changing the code, the app will automatically compile and reload the page.

If you have any trouble to start the Salsah app with ng, you should have a look on the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io) documentation.

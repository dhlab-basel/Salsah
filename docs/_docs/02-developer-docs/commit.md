When writing commit messages, we stick to this schema:

```
type (scope): subject
body
```

Types:

- feature (new feature for the user)
- fix (bug fix for the user)
- docs (changes to the documentation)
- style (formatting, etc; no production code change)
- refactor (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- build (changes to node, node_modules, angular, etc.; no production code changes)
- enhancement (residual category)

Example:

```
feature (resources route): add route for resource creation
- add path for multipart request
- adapt handling of resources responder

```

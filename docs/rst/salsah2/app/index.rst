This is a developer manual and guideline to enhance the new Salsah application.

.. NOTE::
    All the showed figures are mockup drafts or screenshots from an early alpha version. The labels and text in the figures are not the final ones!


The app has two main directories:
one for the view modules (components and directives) and one for the model (api services and classes (json object interfaces)).

***********
Get started
***********

Salsah (System for Annotation and Linkage of Sources in Arts and Humanities) is the generic graphical user interface for Knora_.

It is developed by the `Digital Humanities Lab`_ at the `University of Basel`_, and is supported by the `Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences`_.

Salsah is free software, released under the `GNU Affero General Public License`_ and is available on GitHub_



Prerequisites
=============

Node and NPM
------------

We develop Salsah with Angular_ (v4), especially with Angular-cli_, which requires Node_ 6 or higher and NPM_ 4 or higher. Update NPM to the latest version with ``npm install -g npm@latest``.


Angular-cli
-----------
::

    npm install -g @angular/cli

If there are some permission issues, try to fix them by change the rights in node with

::

    sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}


Salsah app
==========

Installation
------------

After cloning the Salsah code from GitHub_, install the node packages driectly from the Salsah root directory with

::

    npm install


Start
-----

With

::

    ng serve

the Salsah app starts on http://localhost:4200

It could happen, that ng can't resolve some specific packages. In that case the install process did not install the developer packages; install them with

::

    npm install --only=dev


Update node packages
--------------------

From time to time we grab the latest npm package versions for Salsah. To update them, we recommend to reinstall the packages with the following commands.

::

    rm -rf node_modules dist tmp
    npm install --only=dev
    npm install

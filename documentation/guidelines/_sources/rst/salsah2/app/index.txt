This is a developer manual and guideline to enhance the new Salsah application.

.. NOTE::
    All used figures are mockup designs or screenshots from an early alpha version of the app. The labels and names in the figures are not the final product texts!


The app has two main directories:
one for the view modules (components and directives) and one for the model (api services and classes (json object interfaces)).

Project
-------

The main project view has three submodules (and perhaps a fourth). The navigation is handled by a second header panel (at the bottom of the main header) in tabs.

Profile / Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The first tab contains the project dashboard: an overview of recent activities, a description etc.

Team
^^^^
The second tab shows a list of the project team members. The first section lists all project administrators, the second section the "normal" users. If we need more sections -- depending on the group rights -- it shouldn't be a problem to extend the listing.

An administrator of the project is able to add new persons or the edit existing users.

Resources / Ontology Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The third tab contains the resource class and ontology editor.

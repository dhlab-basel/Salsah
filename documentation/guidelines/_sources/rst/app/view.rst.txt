The Salsah app has only a few main view components. They're following the routing_ setup in app-routing.module.ts (with some exceptions e.g. /search).
We organize the main view components in the folders called dashboard, documentation and login.
The last sub-folder in the view is for every other module, which should be reusable in all the main components.

Dashboard components
====================

The main dashboard component is in the root of view/dashboard and it's the start page on Salsah. The start page includes the header and footer components, each with his submodules like search, header toolbar with user and add menus.

The dashboard folder has two sub folders for user and project views, each with sub components which will using in the router-outlet of each main component:

    :maxdepth: 3

    view/dashboard/project/index
    view/dashboard/user/index
